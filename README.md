3 things are needed in orded to be able to pull and download from this repository

1st having git bash or git on the computer to start with. 

2 having a github account and have been given access to this repository.

3 pulling down from github and unzipping the files.



Step one

Going to gitbash and downloading the approtiate software for your computer
https://gitforwindows.org/

All of the setting for installing to windows can be default. You don't need to change anything


Step two

Having gain access to this repository you are already got it done. You will have to grab the code but i will go into that further
on step three

Step three
It best to grab the code thats needed to pull down. You will need either an SSH key to pull
or you can simpily pull from http code.
You are probablu asking where do you find that. Once you made it to the github repository that
stored all the files you will then see a green button that states code
That will open a window inside you have a chose between http or ssh at the top
Your preference


Let say you did the http request. you command will look the following

git pull https://github.com/dobyfreejr/Avalon-OffshoreVR.git that will then pull everything into the folder you want
The folder you pull it to doesn't matter in the slighest.
